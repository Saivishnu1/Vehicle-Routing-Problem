# Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) Optimization using Genetic Algorithms

##  Introduction to Genetic Algorithms

Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are optimization techniques inspired by **natural selection** and **evolutionary biology**. They work by mimicking processes like selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve better solutions over time.

### Why Use Genetic Algorithms?

- They excel at **solving complex optimization problems** where traditional methods struggle.
- They find near-optimal solutions **efficiently** for problems with large search spaces.
- GAs are widely used in **machine learning, logistics, robotics, and game AI**.

### Simple Analogy 

Think of genetic algorithms as **breeding the best racehorses**. We take the fastest ones, crossbreed them, and occasionally introduce a mutation (like a new training technique) to improve the overall performance of future generations.

## The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)

### What is VRP?

The **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)** is a well-known optimization challenge in logistics. It involves **finding the most efficient routes** for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to multiple locations while minimizing cost, distance, or time.

### Why is VRP Important?

- Used in **delivery services (Amazon, FedEx, UPS)**, ride-sharing apps, and supply chain management.
- Optimizing routes saves **fuel, time, and costs**, improving overall efficiency.
- Reduces environmental impact by **cutting unnecessary travel**.

**Challenges:**

- Finding the shortest paths while considering constraints like vehicle capacity, traffic, and delivery time windows.

## Project Implementation & Code Explanation

This project solves the **VRP using Genetic Algorithms** with the **DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python) library**.

### Key Steps:

1. **Problem Setup**

   - Define **locations** (randomly generated coordinates)
   - Define a **central depot** where vehicles start and end

2. **Genetic Algorithm Components**

   - **Population:** A set of possible route solutions
   - **Fitness Function:** Evaluates how good a route is based on distance
   - **Crossover & Mutation:** Combine and tweak routes to improve them
   - **Selection:** Choose the best routes for the next generation

3. **Running the Genetic Algorithm**

   - Define **generations, mutation rates, and selection strategies**
   - Run the algorithm until a near-optimal solution is found

4. **Visualization**

   - Use **Matplotlib** to plot optimized routes

### Code Snippets

#### Defining the Fitness Function

```python
import numpy as np

def evaluate(individual):
    """ Evaluates total route distance for a given solution."""
    total_distance = 0
    start_index = 0
    for i in range(NUM_VEHICLES):
        end_index = start_index + individual.count(i)
        route = [depot] + [locations[j] for j in range(start_index, end_index)] + [depot]
        start_index = end_index
        for k in range(len(route) - 1):
            total_distance += np.linalg.norm(np.array(route[k]) - np.array(route[k + 1]))
    return (total_distance,)
```

#### Plotting the Solution

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_vrp_solution(individual):
    """ Plots the optimized VRP solution."""
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
    plt.scatter(*zip(*locations), c="blue", marker="o", label="Locations")
    plt.scatter(*depot, c="red", marker="s", label="Depot")
    start_index = 0
    for i in range(NUM_VEHICLES):
        end_index = start_index + individual.count(i)
        route = [depot] + [locations[j] for j in range(start_index, end_index)] + [depot]
        start_index = end_index
        x, y = zip(*route)
        plt.plot(x, y, marker="o", label=f"Vehicle {i+1}")
    plt.legend()
    plt.title("Optimized Vehicle Routing Problem Solution")
    plt.show()
```

## Experimentation & Results

### Different Experiments Conducted

- Tested **different selection methods** (Tournament, Roulette Wheel)
- Adjusted **mutation rates** to balance exploration vs. exploitation
- Compared different **crossover strategies** (One-Point, Two-Point, Ordered)

### Observations & Insights

- **Higher mutation rates** led to better diversity but slower convergence
- **Tournament selection** performed better than the roulette wheel for VRP
- **Visualizing solutions** helped in debugging and understanding route efficiency
